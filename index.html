The staging of these events provides an unparalleled opportunity for the host country and city – essentially a global “commercial”. The years leading up to these events can also be used to generate significant long-term business outcomes. 

                    As the host country for both the RWC in 2019 and the Olympic Games in 2020, Japan has a unique opportunity to not only present itself to the world but to also shape future perceptions of its 21st century economic and business credentials.</p>

Both generated significant economic benefits for their respective host cities and countries, and tangible business outcomes for their sponsoring (partner) companies.  (An overview of these initiatives will be attached as clickable documents.)
                    Japan Access 2020 intends to build on the successes, learnings and contacts generated by these programs to produce similar outcomes for Japan. It will also leverage the international experience and contacts of its principals, all of whom were involved in the Sydney 2000 and Beijing 2008 initiatives.</p>

In the period 2017-2020 it is envisaged that this program would entail a minimum of twelve high quality business events in Europe, North America and Australasia, and at least two annual events within Japan.</p>

This unique feature was unequivocally the fundamental factor in their success.  Both initiatives had the full support and involvement of government and relevant sporting organizations, but they were business-to-business initiatives. This operating model ensures that the focus is always on creating real business outcomes for all participating parties.  

                    Similarly Japan Access 2020 will be a private sector activity with a consortium of leading Japanese RWC 2020 and/or Tokyo 2020 sponsors as partners. These partner organizations will be publicly recognized as taking a corporate leadership role in helping to ensure that Japan maximizes the economic, business and social benefits that can arise from the staging of the 2019 RWC and 2020 Olympic Games.

For the past 15 years he has worked with numerous North American, European and Australasian companies to help develop and implement their international expansion strategies for the rapidly growing Asia Pacific region. 
                        During this time he also designed and led the economic “legacy” initiatives for both the Sydney 2000 and Beijing 2008 Olympic Games. These highly successful international business networking and facilitation programs used the staging of the Olympic Games to help build greater long-term international business partnerships, trade and investment between Australia, China and the rest of the world.  Prior to the Sydney Olympic Games, Andrew held several executive positions with Westpac Banking Corporation, Australia’s third largest company. His roles included Head of Asian Business, Head of Global Banking Relationships, Chief of Staff for the Group Executive, and Deputy Chief Economist.
